# An Introduction to Precision Medicine

This practical is part of our comprehensive course An Introduction to Precision Medicine, which is available at:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://sdas.thinkific.com/courses/precmedintro](https://sdas.thinkific.com/courses/precmedintro)

The course introduces the core concepts and methods of precision medicine, with a focus on developing and validating prognostic and predictive models using data from both clinical trials and non-randomized sources. Through interactive tutorials and hands-on practicals in R, participants learn how to explore data, construct risk prediction models, evaluate model performance, and apply these models in clinical decision-making.

This repository includes selected materials and practical exercises designed to support learning and implementation using R and Quarto.
